# Covalent Stream Deck Plugin

To install, copy (or symlink) the contents of the `covalent-streamdeck` folder into a folder named `~/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/Plugins/com.chadbailey.covalent.sdPlugin` on macOS or `%appdata%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins\com.chadbailey.covalent.sdPlugin` on Windows. When you restart the Stream Deck app, you should have a new plugin under "Custom".

As it is, this will only work with calls in the Covalent desktop electron app. I may be able to work it into a Chrome extension at some point.
